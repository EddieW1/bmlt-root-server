7) Swedish Language Ümlauts Result In Bad Location Searches
    This expresses itself in satellite searches, but is probably a root server bug.
    Search for these cities, using the Swedish root server ( http://www.nasverige.org/bmlt ):
        Malmö
        Strängnäs
        Göteborg
    The searches will not produce expected results.
