DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT, hereafter) is a very powerful client/server system
that has been written for a very specific purpose, for a very specific clientele.

It is designed to track and locate Narcotics Anonymous meetings, which are regularly-
scheduled weekly, recurring events.

The intended clientele is Narcotics Anonymous Service bodies. They implement a BMLT
server, and provide the server to other NA Service bodies.

You can find out way too much about the BMLT here: http://magshare.org/bmlt

This project is the "root" server for the BMLT. It is the "server" part of the BMLT
"client/server" architecture.

The project is actually several years old. To see the pre-GitHub history, visit the
original SourceForge page at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/comdef/

I decided to start new on GitHub, as opposed to bringing over the SourceForge project,
in order to reduce disk space usage, and because it's a pain to rearrange a standard
SVN structure to Git.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The entire system is written in PHP, JavaScript, XHTML and CSS. Most of the code is PHP.

PHP 5.1 or above is required to establish a root server, and 5.0 or above for a satellite.

For more information about server requirements, see this page:

INSTALLATION
------------

You set up a root server as the central database and administration area for a BMLT
implementation, but most people access it through what we call "satellite servers." These
satellites comprise the "client" part of the BMLT "client/server" architecture.

For instructions on installing the root server, see this page:

CHANGELIST
----------
= Version 1.8.34 =
* July 4, 2011
* Fixed a validation issue with the search form.

= Version 1.8.33 =
* June 26, 2011
* Added new fields to the CSV/JSON/XML Change response.
* There was a minor security issue that could have occurred with the email_contact field. It may have been displayed in some change records. This has been addressed.
* Made the changes response dig into a hierarchy of Service bodies, if a "parent" Service body ID is presented in service_body_id=
	    
= Version 1.8.32 =
* June 22, 2011
* Added the ability to filter by Service body, when looking for changes, and now only return meeting changes (previously, some Service body and user changes could also be supplied).
* Made a minor fix in the default details address string, so that meeting locations with no name won't show an empty comma.
* Added the address format strings to the shared local strings, which should help performance, and decouple the linking to global variables.

= Version 1.8.31 =
* June 7, 2011
* Added additional capability to the CSV, JSON and XML outputs, so that the Satellite Driver can extract more relevant information.

= Version 1.8.30 =
* June 5, 2011
* Fixed a fairly minor bug, in which failed geocode lookups would result in a blank screen. They now result in a message.

= Version 1.8.29 =
* June 4, 2011
* Initial check-in of GitHub project
