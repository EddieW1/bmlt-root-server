DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT, hereafter) is a very powerful client/server system
that has been written for a very specific purpose, for a very specific clientele.

It is designed to track and locate Narcotics Anonymous meetings, which are regularly-
scheduled weekly, recurring events.

The intended clientele is Narcotics Anonymous Service bodies. They implement a BMLT
server, and provide the server to other NA Service bodies.

You can find out way too much about the BMLT here: http://magshare.org/bmlt

This project is the "root" server for the BMLT. It is the "server" part of the BMLT
"client/server" architecture.

The project is actually several years old. To see the pre-GitHub history, visit the
original SourceForge page at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/comdef/

I decided to start new on GitHub, as opposed to bringing over the SourceForge project,
in order to reduce disk space usage, and because it's a pain to rearrange a standard
SVN structure to Git.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The entire system is written in PHP, JavaScript, XHTML and CSS. Most of the code is PHP.

PHP 5.1 or above is required to establish a root server, and 5.0 or above for a satellite.

For more information about server requirements, see this page:

INSTALLATION
------------

You set up a root server as the central database and administration area for a BMLT
implementation, but most people access it through what we call "satellite servers." These
satellites comprise the "client" part of the BMLT "client/server" architecture.

For instructions on installing the root server, see this page:
