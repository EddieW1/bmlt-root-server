# README #

This is a project to create a "living document," so to speak, for the [BMLT's semantic capabilities](http://bmlt.magshare.net/semantic/).

It will present an interactive "worksheet" that can be used to construct a URL (or shortcode) to present alternative BMLT interfaces.

This file is part of the Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT).
